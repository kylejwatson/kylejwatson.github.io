                    For making our project 'Potpay' during the NatWest Payments Hackathon we won the category 'Most
                    Socially
                    Inclusive'. Our project focused on helping homeless people receive and organise donations using open
                    banking
                    APIs.

                    the 2019
                    Hack Manchester hackathon. We built an Alexa skill for vulnerable people to contact their ICE and

                    I joined this game jam late into the month and so only allocated myself the weekend to work on it.
                    The aim of this jam was to develop a game that could fit into the memory of the Apollo Guidance
                    Computer (32k).
                    I made a very basic 2D Minecraft clone where you can move, pick up and place blocks, and craft. It
                    was written in QBasic for MS-DOS/DOSBox.
                    The size of the game with the required BRUN45.EXE bundled and zipped came to 28,606 bytes but the
                    game alone came to only 8,192 bytes!

                    We developed a website with a functioning back-end and database over the weekend with ideas for

                    For this hackathon the goal was to create a complaint system, which would infuriate someone making a
                    complaint. We developed a system to enter the complaints with gif images/animations instead of
                    words.

            This is a game I decided to build to improve my skills with making my own game/physics engine in
            Java. The game uses JavaFX to draw the graphics. The physics engine includes terrain with
            destructable properties as well as polygon collision detection with friction and forces.
            The engine works for the gameplay as well as the level editor built to make level creation easier. Levels
            are stored as lists of polygon coordinates.

                    This app was developed for the final assignment in the Android Development course at HvA. The app connects
                    to a Firebase database and uses Firebase for user authenticaton. It uses the Heroku thumbnailer API to
                    retrieve URL thumbnails and loads them with Glide. It uses many different components of the Android platform
                    including dialogs, recycler-views, fragments and notifications. This recieved the first 10/10 grade that the
