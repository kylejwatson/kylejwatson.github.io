To use the NodeJS AWS SDK in Kotlin, you need to provide an external interface to the functions you want to use. Though, once this is set up, it can be re-used across projects. The NodeJS runtime is also officially supported, and its start times are better than the JVM runtimes, however performance may be slower if a lot of multithreading is needed.\",\"nodeType\":\"text\"}],\"nodeType\":\"paragraph\"},{\"data\":{},\"content\":[{\"data\":{},\"marks\":[],\"value\":\"To use Kotlin Native on Lambda requires the use of a custom runtime. This can be built and provided by using open-source docker containers for the desired architecture/environment.
