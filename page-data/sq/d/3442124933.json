It was expected to be a small event as only 10 people had RSVP'd but only the host, the two speakers, one audience member and I showed up (probably because the world cup was on at the same time). It was a nice experience anyhow as I got to have a proper chat with everyone there."},"updatedAt":"26 November, 2022","category":"Meetups"}},{"node":{"path":"/blog/aws-community-day-nl-2022/","title":"AWS Community Day NL","id":"6f528bd3-bb46-5abe-b93b-b0553dae032c","summary":{"summary":"On the 3rd of October I attended AWS Community Day NL 2022 hosted in Amersfoort.

While React-based talks aren't always directly useful for my professional work in Angular, it can still be interesting to learn from more general ideas and techniques that can be applied to other frameworks. Not to mention, I use React in personal projects as well."},"updatedAt":"26 November, 2022","category":"Meetups"}},{"node":{"path":"/blog/aws-ug-nl-5th-year/","title":"AWS User Group Netherlands - 5th year anniversary meetup","id":"fb201011-03ff-5073-a46b-5b95db072acc","summary":{"summary":"Yesterday evening I attended the AWS UG NL 5th year anniversary meetup in Amsterdam.
