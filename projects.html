                    This is the 3D re-imagining of the earlier <a href="#gren2018">Grenade Jumper</a> game, built in
                    Unity for the first
                    semester
                    3D Games module in UoS. The game features physics based motion and traversal, as well as
                    post-processing, animation and screen-space UIs.

            This is a game I decided to build to improve my skills with making my own game/physics engine in
            Java. The game uses JavaFX to draw the graphics. The physics engine includes terrain with
            destructable properties as well as polygon collision detection with friction and forces.
            The engine works for the gameplay as well as the level editor built to make level creation easier. Levels
            are stored as lists of polygon coordinates.

                    This app was developed for the final assignment in the Android Development course at HvA. The app
                    connects
                    to a Firebase database and uses Firebase for user authenticaton. It uses the Heroku thumbnailer API
                    to
                    retrieve URL thumbnails and loads them with Glide. It uses many different components of the Android
                    platform
                    including dialogs, recycler-views, fragments and notifications. This recieved the first 10/10 grade
                    that the
                    teacher had ever given a student as I had "clearly shown passion and drive in creating this".

                    This game was developed for the second semester assignment for the VR module at UoS. The game builds
                    upon the Unity skills developed from <a href="#gren2019">Grenade Jumper</a> with work done on
                    performance and VR controls. I also used this as an opportunity to learn about other aspects of game
                    design by making all of the assets from scratch using FOSS applications. The sound effects were made
                    using modular synthesis in the program <a href="https://vcvrack.com/">VCV Rack</a>. The two music
                    tracks were made in <a href="https://lmms.io/">LMMS</a>. The models were made with <a
                        href="https://www.blender.org/">Blender</a>. The textures were made with <a
                        href="https://www.gimp.org/">GIMP</a>.

                    The app is

                    multithreading and using sensors in this assignment.
