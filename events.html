                    For making our project 'Potpay' during the NatWest Payments Hackathon we won the category 'Most
                    Socially
                    Inclusive'. Our project focused on helping homeless people receive and organise donations using open
                    banking
                    APIs.

                    As part of Team Red Summit we won the prize for the 'best student/next generation solution' during
                    the 2019
                    Hack Manchester hackathon. We built an Alexa skill for vulnerable people to contact their ICE and
                    the
                    emergency services in different scenarios.

                    I joined this game jam late into the month and so only allocated myself the weekend to work on it.
                    The aim of this jam was to develop a game that could fit into the memory of the Apollo Guidance
                    Computer (32k).
                    I made a very basic 2D Minecraft clone where you can move, pick up and place blocks, and craft. It
                    was written in QBasic for MS-DOS/DOSBox.
                    The size of the game with the required BRUN45.EXE bundled and zipped came to 28,606 bytes but the
                    game alone came to only 8,192 bytes!

                    With a team composed of complete strangers we managed to develop an idea for an interactive 3D
                    neighbourhood
                    planning application. I worked on the Unity implementation with the help from the UX designers, 3D
                    specialists and architects on the team.

                    easier donation/sponsor collection for the Kinder Postzegels fundraiser.
                    We developed a website with a functioning back-end and database over the weekend with ideas for
                    expansion.

                    For this hackathon the goal was to create a complaint system, which would infuriate someone making a
                    complaint. We developed a system to enter the complaints with gif images/animations instead of
                    words.
